Starting a new skill should be exciting ‚Äî but too often, it feels overwhelming, with scattered resources and no clear path. Frustrating, right?

# Imagining the Possibilitiesüí°

Now, picture this: learning made effortless, focused, and inspiring.

Say hello to the future of growth ‚Äî a revolutionary learning path system designed to adapt to your dreams:

- Personalize your journey to match your goals.
- Track your progress with clarity and ease.
- Discover curated resources tailored just for you.
- Celebrate every milestone as you grow.

It‚Äôs time to learn smarter, faster, and with purpose. Together, let‚Äôs transform how you achieve your goals.

# What Did We Create?ü§î

We built something powerful:

- A FastAPI backend powered by Gemini AI to craft personalized learning paths.
- A smart progress tracker using a custom database schema to keep you on course.
- Seamless, scalable tech with Firebase and FastAPI, delivering a solution that‚Äôs fast, intuitive, and empowering.

This isn‚Äôt just another tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs your ultimate growth companion, built to inspire and elevate.

# Building Blocks of Innovation: The Architecture Behind Skill Starter

![Architecture](./images/Architecture.png)

- FastAPI: Core backend for user requests, path generation, and tracking.
- Cloud Firestore: NoSQL database for real-time data storage.
- Gemini: User-facing platform to access personalized paths.

# Steps to Implement the System

Create Credentials for Gemini and Firebase: Establish secure credentials and API keys for Gemini and Firebase, ensuring smooth integration and robust authentication for all interactions.

Refine Prompt for Precision: Enhance input queries to deliver highly accurate and relevant responses. Focus on aligning prompts with desired outcomes to optimize data retrieval and performance.

Develop the API: Build a reliable and scalable API to fetch and deliver data efficiently. Design endpoints to integrate seamlessly with Gemini and Firebase, ensuring consistency and reliability.

```
import google.generativeai as genai
genai.configure(api_key=os.environ.get('GEMINI_API_KEY'))
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")

```

<pre>
<code>
@router.get("/gemini/generate")
async def get_gemini_data(technology: str,curr_expertise:str, time_in_months: float, goal: Optional[str] = "", known_technologies: Optional[str] = ""):
    prompt = f'''<your promptüòÖ>'''
    # TODO: add history if specified
    chat = model.start_chat()
    response = chat.send_message(prompt)
    return json.loads(response.text)
</code>
</pre>
Set Up the Database: Create a well-structured, secure database optimized for fast queries and scalability. Prioritize data integrity and secure storage for long-term reliability.

from firebase_admin import firestore, initialize_app, credentials
import os
<pre>
<code>

cred = credentials.Certificate('<Your credential JSON>')

initialize_app(cred)
db = firestore.client()

user_collection = db.collection('users')
learning_collection = db.collection('learnings')
Connect API Services and Database: Integrate API endpoints with the database to enable seamless communication and real-time data synchronization across the system.
